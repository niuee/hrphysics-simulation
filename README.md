This is a very simple physics simulation that I implemented using Python.
I plan to use it as part of the horse racing simulation and managing game. 


Currently, the world is set up as a top-down view.
The direction of gravity is pointing into the screen. (negative Z axis)
The current visualizing user interface is implemented using Pyglet.
However, the world and rigid body simulation are separated from the visual part of the project.
Therefore, in the future the visualizing part can be swapped out; I plan to use Pillow as the other visualizing alternative.
The simulation can also run lacking the visual part of it. 

Detail documentation of the project would be gradually added to the README file, I just don't have the time right now.
